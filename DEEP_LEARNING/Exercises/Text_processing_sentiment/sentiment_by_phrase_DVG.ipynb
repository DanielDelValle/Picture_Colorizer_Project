       "       b'possibly the worst film within the genre in existence it was announced as a comedy but is simply tragically pathetic i dont think anyone could have achieved anything more terrible and irritating if they were specifically requested to it is toilet humour at its very poorest i would avoid even watching the trailer i only went to see it because it was announced that if you like monty python you are bound to love this whoever wrote that was either biased or seriously deranged i am still bewildered how one can honestly believe such a statement rarely do i leave the cinema really it takes a lot of effort for a film to have that effect on me this one did it in just 30 minutes',\n",

       "       b'lately they have been trying to hock this film latenight on cable tv commercials dont believe the hype i was one of the unlucky people to see this stinker in theatres this is in my opinion the 3rd worst movie of all time just behind mac  me 1 worst and jack frost 2 worst but i must admit they are all close and all terrible really nothing of this movie is funny or disturbing or anything else it claims to be so dont waste your money the only thing it is good for is giving to your worst enemy im not lying about that someone who you would love to kill or torture would be a prime candidate for this film it is that awful if you dont believe me then you deserve to suffer through the misery of watching this which i doubt you can finish two thumbs enthusiastically down',\n",
